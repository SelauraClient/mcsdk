# Contributing
MCSDK is a completely open-source and free-use library that you can put in your Minecraft: Bedrock Edition mods. If you are making any mods, or are reversing Minecraft: Bedrock Edition in any way, we would love it if you could contribute to this SDK for all to use.

## Naming Conventions
Our naming conventions allow for ease when figuring out the methods needed for your mod. In general, try to keep names concise and easy to remember. Use ```UpperCamelCase``` for classes, namespaces, and structs. Use ```lowerCamelCase``` for functions and non-constant variables and fields, and ```UPPER_SNAKE_CASE``` for constant variables and fields.

### Spelling
Use American English for spelling, and if spellings are disputed, use the most common spelling or the spelling used in other places.

### Mojang Names
Use names similar to Mojang's unless it is confusing or does not describe itself well. However, still, follow our naming conventions and keep it concise if possible.
